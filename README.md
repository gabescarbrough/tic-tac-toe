I began planning this project by sketching rough wireframes of how I wanted my
game to look on paper. Based on these sketches I created the wireframes attached
above. Referencing these wireframes I created the front-end’s components and
look using HTML and SCSS.

Next followed the game logic, which is where I began to face some issues. While
I had a hard time with some of the game logic at first, such as placing markers
in the squares and win checking, I was able to pinpoint where I was going wrong
by being methodical, and console logging to see if I was getting the data I
expected. I worked on a new branch for each feature which allowed me to better
 keep track of what was being changed where.

Once my game logic was complete, I wrote cURL requests to communicate with the
back-end and become acquainted with what it expected and returned. Once I
understood the expectations, I wrote the AJAX code for the front-end to
communicate with the back-end to create and store games. This was the hardest
part for me, and required reading a lot of documentation and rewriting my
code multiple times once I realized why my application was not behaving the way
I expected.

Originally I had planned to show and hide the user interface options depending
on whether a user is logged in. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to get to this
but I would like to go back and implement this feature.

While I definitely faced challenges along the way, I am happy with how this
application came out given the amount of time I had and how new I am to web app
development.

I definitely plan to return to this project and improve it once I know
even more.
